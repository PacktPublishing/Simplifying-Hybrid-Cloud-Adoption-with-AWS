**Realize edge computing and build compelling hybrid solutions on premises with AWS Outposts**

## What is this book about?
The hybrid edge specialty is often misunderstood because it began with an on-premises-focused view encompassing everything not running inside the traditional data center. If you too have workloads that need to live on premises and need a solution to bridge the gap between both worlds, this book will show you how AWS Outposts allows workloads to leverage the benefits of the cloud running on top of AWS technology.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover the role of AWS Outposts in the hybrid edge space
* Understand rack components with typical use cases for AWS Outposts
* Explore AWS services running on Outposts and its capabilities
* Select, order, and successfully deploy your Outposts
* Work with Outposts resources for hands-on operations
* Assess logical and physical security aspects and considerations
* Monitor and log configuration and usage to improve your architecture
* Maintain and troubleshoot hardware and software that run AWS services

## Get to Know the Author
**Frankie Costa Negro**
is a technology wanderer. He began in IT as a FoxPro / dBase developer in 1994. Quite a lot has happened since then: heroic days learning Microsoft Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Creating macros with Microsoft Excel 5.0, and transitioning to Visual Basic 3.0. His developer career ended with Visual Basic 6.0 when he was invited to be a sysadmin in 1997. A lot of water has gone under the bridge and his on-premises stint ended in 2018 with an invitation to join AWS as a Cloud Support Engineer. Since then, it has all been hard work while having fun and making history. He came full circle by joining the AWS Outposts team to flex his on-premises muscles once again. When he is not working for AWS, he is working accompanied by music.
